# Flip Happens

\
_"Flip Happens"_ is a fast-paced platformer where you play as a stylish skater doing cool tricks and reacting fast through creative levels full of obstacles.

Your goal: collect all the letters (A, B, C, D...) in the correct alphabetical order – as fast as possible!\
But watch out: you can only collect a letter if it's the correct next one. If you try to grab the wrong one, nothing happens. So every jump and grind counts – timing and awareness are super important!

 #### Features:
- Fast, smooth gameplay with focus on speed and flow
- 2 Creative levels that get harder the further you go
- Letter challenges: collect all letters in the right alphabetical order
- Leaderboards: compete with other speedrunners

#### Controls:
- A – Move left
- D – Move right
- SPACE – Jump
- ESC – Pause the game
